Dear Developer! I'll try to leave all heads up that I can find in this project here

The Tailwind Setup in this project is using desktop first setup. 

Using any Python version > 3.8 will introduce breaking changes to the application; Proceed at your own peril

Install Psql before setting your application on your system

To save you from heart attack, JS files rarely throws error - exception being when 
 - it's a syntax error
 - if it's a selection error

Before pushing your application, make sure that you have your compresed css files ready in the codebase.

Dear Developer! I'll try to leave all heads up that I can find in this project here

The Tailwind Setup in this project is using desktop first setup. 
Using any Python version > 3.8 will introduce breaking changes to the application
Install Psql before setting your application on your system
To save you from heart attack, JS files rarely throws error - exception being when 
 - it's a syntax error
 - if it's a selection error

 Why? I dunno
